| Feature                | Monolithic Architecture             | Microservices Architecture              |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Structure**          | Single codebase                     | Multiple independent services            |
| **Coupling**           | Tightly coupled                     | Loosely coupled                          |
| **Development Speed**  | Faster initially                    | Slower to start, faster at scale         |
| **Scalability**        | Scale the entire application        | Scale services independently             |
| **Maintenance**        | Harder as app grows                 | Easier due to separation of concerns     |
| **Deployment**         | Single deployment unit              | Independent service deployments          |
| **Tech Stack**         | Usually one tech stack              | Polyglot (different tech per service)    |
| **Failure Impact**     | One failure can crash the whole app | Failures are isolated per service        |
| **Best For**           | Small, simple applications          | Large, complex, scalable applications    |
