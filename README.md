# 🧑‍💼 Freelance Marketplace – Microservices Architecture

This project documents the architectural design and functional breakdown of a freelance marketplace platform (similar to Fiverr or Upwork), built using a **microservices-based architecture**.

---

## 📚 Overview

This documentation covers the system design decisions, microservices responsibilities, communication protocols, and infrastructure for building a scalable, maintainable, and robust freelance marketplace. It is intended for both engineering teams and stakeholders to understand the overall architecture.

---

## 📌 Key Features

- 🧩 Microservices-based architecture
- 🌐 API Gateway as the single entry point
- 🔒 JWT-based authentication
- 📬 Event-driven inter-service communication via RabbitMQ
- 💬 Real-time chat via Socket.io
- 🔍 Centralized logging and monitoring with Elasticsearch and Kibana
- ⚙️ Scalable and secure deployment strategy

## 🧱 Core Microservices

| Microservice        | Responsibilities                                       |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Auth Service        | Login, signup, token generation and verification       |
| User Service        | User profiles, seller/buyer roles, preferences         |
| Gig Service         | Creating, editing, and listing freelance gigs          |
| Order Service       | Order placement, status updates, payment hooks         |
| Review Service      | Ratings and feedback from buyers and sellers           |
| Chat Service        | Real-time messaging using WebSockets (Socket.io)       |
| Notification Service| Sending emails, alerts, in-app notifications           |

## 🔗 Communication Architecture

- **Client → API Gateway**: via HTTP / WebSockets
- **API Gateway → Microservices**: HTTP + Socket.io
- **Microservice ↔ Microservice**: Asynchronous messaging using RabbitMQ
